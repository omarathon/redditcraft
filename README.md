-------

RedditCraft is a Minecraft Server plugin that integrates your presence on a Minecraft server to a server-wide subreddit.

It's essentially a Minecraft Server forum alternative.

A Minecraft player may authenticate their Reddit account, and transfer their prefix in-game to the subreddit as a flair. Or, the flair may be set by predication on their Minecraft account's permissions, where certain flair groups require certain in-game permissions. These groups may additionally be composed if the server has a more complex rank system.
